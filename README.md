### Tell us what your idea is.

The idea is to develop an app that can help the visually impaired or old people in identifying the denomination of a currency they are having by giving audio feedback to the user when they capture the photo of the currency from their mobile phone. The app will also show the details in the form of text which will be useful for partially blind people and people traveling to different countries to identify the denomination of a currency.
 

### Tell us how you plan on bringing it to life.
I am planning to implement this app using a pre-trained model and tensorflow lite. The reason for choosing tensorflow instead of Auto ML vision online service is to provide offline serivces to user so that user does not have to depend on a internet connection as in many developing countries many people have limited bandwidth and metered connections thus providing the offline support is the best approach according to me.

### Timeline
